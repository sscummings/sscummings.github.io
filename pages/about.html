            <h2>Hello! I'm Stephen. I make things.</h2>

            <p>I’m an artist! I make photographs and write words. I design websites. I’m the co-curator of an art show called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/welcome_to_salad/" target="_blank">Salad</a>. I live in Brooklyn, but I like to travel and try out new languages. I studied painting and drawing at Arizona State University and the University of Washington. I’ve worked in politics, including presidential campaigns for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. A long time ago I wrote about art for my hometown weekly, <a href="https://renonr.com/author/stephen-cummings/" target="_blank">Reno News & Review</a>. There’s gotta be something we can create together, right? Get in touch, and let’s see what we can do.</p>
