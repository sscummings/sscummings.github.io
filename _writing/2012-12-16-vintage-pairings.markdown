The piece that perhaps best crystallizes the inherent strangeness of Haman's photographic exploration is a set of seagulls, one a living, breathing, frozen creature, captured by the artist's frame, the other a molded, stilted restaurant prop, anchored to an outside wall. The birds assume nearly identical postures in mid-flight and would be mid-flight, and highlight the artificiality of the whole representational endeavor. Which of these, after all, is the more real? From life and decor, Haman has gleaned strikingly similar arrangements. His is a reality rooted in experience, but ultimately created, one in which the outside world is transformed into the reality on the wall.
